        Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. 
        Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, 
        individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video game culture, 
        these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by 
        professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a 
        large surge in popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, 
        with many game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.
